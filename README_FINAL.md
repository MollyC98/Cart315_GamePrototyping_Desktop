### Introduction  
The first question the game makes you think as a player is; what makes humans a human? Is it just the consciousness that becomes the bridge between an AI and Human? One of the interesting things I have been observing within the game is that: there are several recordings as you proceed in the virtual world. Alexandra Drennan who used to be a human researcher working on the project Talos (as the narrative dictates) provides contexts of the player’s actions in the form of recordings. Through her voice the players understand the ethical and philosophical dilemmas the creators of the virtual world faced while looking for answers. One of her prompts defining the gap between Ai(s) and Humans felt very interesting to me it said “ Playing Games is a way of differentiating between humans and AI, because we don’t just play to learn something or to solve a problem, we play for fun, joy, sometimes anger and several other emotions which is not possible for an AI to comprehend the depth of it as it is possible for the humans”  
Throughout the game, players encounter various texts, audio recordings, and messages that further explore the implications of the Talos Principle. These philosophical musings and challenges contribute to the overall narrative and thematic depth of "The Talos Principle," creating an experience that goes beyond traditional puzzle-solving games.
