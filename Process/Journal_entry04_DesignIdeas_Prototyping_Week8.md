### Character 
![Character](Images/ninja.png)
The player embodies the persona of a stealthy ninja, adept at slipping through the shadows undetected, embodying a mysterious demeanor. As they navigate the museum's corridors in pursuit of the stolen treasures, their cunning and agility allow them to outmaneuver the guards. This ninja protagonist, with their enigmatic allure and formidable skills, serves as both the protagonist and the antagonist, conducting a daring heist to reclaim what rightfully belongs to the nations from which it was taken. This character design encapsulates the essence of a masterful detective, operating courageously to achieve their objectives without drawing unwanted attention.

### Gameplay
The player assumes the role of a daring thief on a mission to reclaim treasures plundered by the British from various countries throughout history. With a ticking clock adding urgency, the thief must navigate through a museum, aiming to locate and steal as many treasures as possible before making a clean getaway. To access certain prized artifacts, keys are essential, hidden within chests guarded by spectral entities. While contact with these ghosts doesn't end the game, it does incur time penalties. Additionally, the thief must evade detection by museum guards and sidestep security lasers, as any encounter with either will result in immediate failure.

### List of assets to be done
1) Player character sprites (normal, jump, run, climbing up/down, defeat)
2) Main background that is not interactable (museum background with windows, paintings, pillars etc.)
3) Interactable assets to move around (ladders, doors, platforms, floor grounds, etc.)
4) Key items (to unlock some rooms, a different one for each treasure)
5) Treasure items (each one gives the player some points)
6) Guards sprites (walking back and forth. The player needs to avoid touching them by jumping on platforms)
7) Laser sprites (in some sections of the museum, they go quickly across the room and the player needs to stay immobile to not be detected)
8) Colonial ghost sprites (optional, guarding the keys like the guards, but sometimes appear and disappear, makes the player lose time if they get in contact with them)
9) Opening & ending cutscene (optional, in a visual novel style or a comic style??)
10) UI and stuff
11) Title screen and Game over screen
12) Music & sound effects (we will get them from the internet)

### Additional Gameplay Mechanics (Optional) 
1) Puzzles and Riddles: To unlock a chest containing a key, the player must decipher Tetris patterns found on museum artifacts, piecing together clues scattered throughout the level. They might also need to rearrange paintings in a gallery to reveal hidden symbols that unlock secret passages.
2) Multiple Endings: At the end of the game, the player is presented with a choice: return the stolen artifacts to their rightful owners and gain redemption, or keep them and face the consequences of their actions. Each choice leads to a different ending, affecting the outcome of the story.
3) Dynamic AI: Guards have different patrol patterns and behaviors based on the difficulty level chosen by the player. Higher difficulty levels introduce smarter AI that can anticipate the player's movements and adapt to their strategies.

### Feedback from last class 
1) Make it Stealth-Platformer game 
2) incorporate various types of enemies 
3) Make it informative in a witty way, for example at the end of the game producing the list of items the ninja recovered and stating facts about the items, the country they belong to or how it was stolen. 
4) Adding ghosts like creatures inspired from Harry Potter movies and books. 
5) Make the character hide at the certain occasions within the game, this keeps the mystery alive.
